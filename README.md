- Hi, Iâ€™m @terR0Q, started programming in 2002 in senior school.
- I'm little bit poliglotical in coding languages and frameworks: Java (Swing and Kotlin included) C#, PHP (Yii, Laravel), Python/Django, Perl (mod_perl with CPAN), JS (React, VUE, TS), C++ (never forget that financial server update), Swift, Ruby, Visual Basic (started on my own from this one). With database experience in MySQL, Postgresql, Mongodb and Oracle.
- Most current practice in PHP/Laravel, Java/Kotlin, Swift and JS/React.
- Most of my activity in past 15 years goes for web services of all sorts. In the past 3 years I moved more to mobile and edutainment.
- You can reach me via telegram @terr0q
