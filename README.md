- Hi, Iâ€™m @terR0Q, started programming in 2002 in senior school.
- I'm graduated practical information analyst. Which makes me something like Paladin: swings a sword (code), casts spells (creates detailed tasks for collegues) and swears a lot (team leading).
- I'm little bit poliglotical in coding languages and frameworks: Java (Swing and Kotlin included) C#, PHP (Yii, Laravel), Python/Django, Perl (mod_perl with CPAN), JS (React, VUE, TS), C++ (never forget that financial server update), Swift, Ruby, Visual Basic (started on my own from this one).
  - With database experience in MySQL, Postgresql, Mongodb and Oracle.
  - Linked tech I'm working with: Debian/Ubuntu, Macos, iOS, Android, Windows, redis, memcache, master/slave architectures, Composer, NodeJS, docx/xlsx auto generation, GoF patterns.
- Most current practice in PHP/Laravel, Java/Kotlin, Swift and JS/React.
- Most of my activity in past 15 years goes for web services of all sorts. In the past 3 years I moved more to mobile and edutainment.
- You can reach me via telegram @terr0q
